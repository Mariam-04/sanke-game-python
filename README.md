Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the pygame library. The goal of the game is to move the snake around the screen, eat the food, and grow in length. Be careful not to run into the walls or the snake's own body, or the game will be over.

How to Play
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the snake:
Left Arrow: Move left
Right Arrow: Move right
Up Arrow: Move up
Down Arrow: Move down
The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
The game ends if the snake runs into the wall or itself.
